const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, which is the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified."
const design = "This is the thrid step, which is reusable solutions applied to commonly occurring problems in writing JavaScript web applications."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, which is a library that attempts to bring interfaces to JavaScript."
const TestingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, which is a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity."
const Maintain = "This is the sixth step, which is the process of modifying a software or program after delivery to achieve any of these outcomes. Correct errors improve performance, add functionalities and remove obsolete portions."
